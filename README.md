# A IT-Forensics Python tool to fetch Images and their METADATA (and decode the METADATA to render them readable). The tool will also create a Database for the fetched Images and their corresponding METADATA and will also create a local HTML file that utilizes the Database to showcase the fetched information in a proper way.

Keep in mind it is expected you have a cloned copy of the entirety of a Samsung phone in a .zip format (THIS IS NOT PROVIDED HERE). In my usage my file name was S21.zip
